const ROI_INFO = `
Roi Shikler is an accomplished product leader, deep technology enthusiast, and former military engineer with a career spanning cutting-edge AI applications, defense-grade R&D, and real-world product delivery in autonomous systems. He currently serves as an Algo Product Manager at Mobileye, where he leads the product suite of parking technologies across both ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and AV (Autonomous Vehicle) domains. Roi oversees in-production systems as well as future offerings, acting as the central interface between internal teams and external partners. His role involves high-frequency interaction with global automotive customers, running product demonstrations, and driving roadmap alignment across technical and business layers.

Roi brings a multidisciplinary background in AI research, mechanical engineering, and strategic technology development. His professional foundation was built during an impactful tenure in the Israeli Ministry of Defense, particularly in the Directorate of Defense Research & Development (DDR&D, also known as MAFAT). As a Senior R&D Project Manager, he led major innovation efforts at the national level, delivering complex projects that required multi-year planning, deep cross-organizational collaboration, and integration of advanced AI capabilities into sensitive systems. His contributions included both hardware and software initiatives and were carried out in close coordination with military stakeholders and international partners.

Prior to that, Roi served in the Israeli Air Force, where his career evolved from diagnostic engineering to AI research. As a Diagnostic Researcher, he investigated mechanical failures in aircraft, playing a direct role in enhancing flight safety through root-cause analysis and corrective implementation. He later transitioned into a Data Science Researcher role within the OFEK 324 unit, where he led machine learning and deep learning deployments, translated operational pain points into ML solutions, and embedded predictive models into daily military operations. His work in classifying airborne objects significantly contributed to national security and operational awareness, particularly during the 2023–2025 regional conflicts.

In parallel to his full-time roles, Roi also completed a 70-day reserve duty mission in 2023, supporting the national defense effort against UAV threats. He contributed to the research, development, and deployment of hundreds of advanced counter-UAV systems across Israel, reinforcing homeland defense infrastructure during a critical period.

Roi holds both a Bachelor and Master of Science from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. He graduated from the elite "Brakim" program in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in robotics and simulation. His Master's research focused on computer vision and deep learning applied to fractographic image analysis using scanning electron microscopy. He independently created a labeled image dataset used by other researchers, and his thesis remains archived in the Technion library.

Roi is also an entrepreneur at heart. In 2023, he co-founded a stealth-stage startup in the business intelligence space, where he served as CTO. Though he chose to step away early in the process, the experience refined his understanding of product-market fit, founder dynamics, and the importance of aligning team needs with individual strengths. In the past, Roi developed several technology-driven side projects, including:

Locals App (2020): A mobile application designed to help local businesses maintain liquidity during the COVID-19 lockdown by encouraging prepaid service purchases.

Pardes Shmaryahu (2022): An NFT-based project that sold graphical representations of Israeli agricultural fields, aiming to expose new audiences to blockchain and digital ownership.

Ofekalkali (2020–present): A financial education blog and community that breaks down complex economic concepts for a general audience.

Beyond his formal work, Roi is passionate about remaining at the forefront of technological evolution. He closely follows developments in artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and blockchain-based infrastructure. His curiosity extends to robotics and emerging forms of automation, and he actively engages in experimental "vibe coding" — a personal method of building small-scale tech projects that test new stacks and ideas.

Roi's work is guided by a set of core principles: the drive to build meaningful, high-impact solutions; a belief in lifelong learning; and a deep appreciation for collaboration and empathy, especially in complex, multi-stakeholder environments. He is motivated by the ability to translate data and technology into real-world influence — whether in operational systems, consumer products, or public policy.

In his personal life, Roi is married to Dr. Aya Bardugo, a physician and research leader who heads the research division of the IDF Medical Corps. Aya's work focuses on advancing the health and well-being of soldiers, and Roi takes deep pride in her contributions. They share a life in Tel Aviv with their two children: Nadav, born in January 2021, and Tom, born in October 2023. Roi is an active and engaged father who balances work with family life, and he enjoys spending time with his family on hikes, road trips, and culinary adventures.

He is also an avid traveler, gym-goer, and both indoor and outdoor climber. Roi's long-term vision includes either founding a startup, growing into senior leadership in tech, or potentially taking a role in the public sector to influence policy through data-driven decision-making. Whatever the path, he is committed to staying at the edge of innovation and using his skills to make a meaningful difference.
